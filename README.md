## Summary
This is one of my first projects using a combination of Javascript, HTML and CSS. Although it was not very challenging, it was very intersting to learn more about how interval functions and DOM manipulation works in JavaScript. Looking forward to taking this knowledge and applying it to more intricate applications.
